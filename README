Simple test program to interface directly with ZTE Blade's FMRadio Chipset.

Not responsible for any major screwups - you're on your own :P

Parameters where n is specified as digit(s):
	-a [n]		Audio Track, 0 for Stereo, 1 for Mono
	-b [n]		Band mode, 0 for Generic, 1 for Japan Wide, 2 for Japan, 3 for reserved... (snoop in on CB's?)
	-f			Displays the current frequency, this is known to "stick" to 8750 ... a BUG... \o/
	-j [n]		Jump Spacer, 0 for 50Khz, 1 for 100Khz, 2 for 200Khz (I think?)
	-s [x,y]	AutoSeek, x can be 0 for seek down, 1 for seek up. y can be a frequency you want to autoseek to.
	-t [n]		Tune into specified frequency
	-v [n]		Volume, 0 is mute, 15 is max... not 100% sure, if this can be confirmed...
	-1			Turns on radio
	-0			Turns off radio

Info regarding RDS and Andorko's patch, this will need investigating as there is no ioctl for that.... will double check!

Combine them all to see what results you get... and let me know...

Oh and yeah, hold down Ctrl, hit C, release Ctrl. to break and end the program.

PROOF OF CONCEPT WORKS \/\/00+ \o/

Have fun
